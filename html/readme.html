<h2>Introduction</h2>

mctooLAME is an  Mpeg 2 Layer 2 Multi-Channel audio encoder.  It is based heavily on 
<UL>
    <LI>the ISO dist10 code 
    <LI>toolame
    <LI>improvement to algorithms as part of the LAME project (www.sulaco.org/mp3)
    <LI>work by myself and other contributors (see CONTRIBUTORS)
</ul>
This release is alpha-ish. It should produce valid mpeg streams from 5-channel or 6-channel AIFF files.

<h2>History</h2>
See <a href="history.html">history</a>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<OL>
<LI> edit Makefile (at least change the architecture type [ARCH] to suit your machine)
<LI> 'make'
</ol>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<pre>
         ./mctoolame [options] [input file] [output file]

Input File
	mctooLAME parses AIFF files for file info
        a 5 or 6 channel AIFF file is required.

Input Options
        (run mctooLAME without args for a full list)

Output File
        If you don't specify, then the output file = inputfile.mp2

</pre>

<h2>Examples</h2>
Don't get too fancy for the time being.
<pre>
	mctoolame sound.aiff
</pre>
This should produce a single mpeg audio file with all the multichannel extensions at 192kbps.</P>
Trying to set bitrates tends to stuff things up. YMMV. </p>

<h2>To Do</h2>
<UL>
<LI> Faster FFT from toolame
<LI> Currently only uses psymodel 1
<LI> Fix audio parsing. it's a shocker
<LI> Add support for more common audio file inputs (?)
</UL>
